Multicore computing
###################

PyHRF can make computation on several cores using the
`joblib <https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/>`_ python package. Joblib is an
optional dependency of PyHRF so if you plan to use multiprocessing computation
you need to install it (refer to the :doc:`installation <../installation>` page)

Configuration
-------------

You can configure the number of used cores by setting the ``nb_procs`` option in
the :doc:`pyhrf configuration file <pyhrf_configuration>`. If you want to a
uto-detect the number of processors and cores that the system can use, set this
option to ``0``.

Use
---

When calling the ``pyhrf_jde_vem_analysis`` script, the multiprocessing mode is
active by default. If you want to disable it use ``--no-parallel`` command line
option.
