This page sums up some advices on how to visualize PyHRF results.

NeuroElf
########

For exploration of results, you can use the `NeuroElf viewer <http://neuroelf.net/>`_
with small modifications of the code to allow better visualization of HRFs and results.
NeuroElf is a MATLAB toolbox so you'll need to have MATLAB installed on your system.

Installation
------------

Go to the `NeuroElf <http://neuroelf.net/>`_ page and follow instructions for
NeuroElf installation. Prefer the *flat folder snapshot*, extract it and add
the path to your MATLAB's path.

For easier use of the tool, you can modify part of the code for better HRF and
PPMs visualizations. The modifications for PyHRF are available
`here for download <../_static/NeuroElf_modifications.tar.xz>`_ (just replace the
original files).

If you prefer (for advanced use) you can alternatively download the
`patched version <../_static/NeuroElf_modifications_patch.tar.xz>`_.

Use
---

#. Run NeuroElf from MATLAB: ``neuroelf_gui``.
#. (Optional) From the ``File`` menu, click on ``Open...`` and select the
   Anatomical file from the subject.
#. From the ``File`` menu, open the ``jde_vem_hrf_mapped.nii`` file.
#. From the ``File`` menu, select the ``Set underlay object`` item and select
   either the loaded anatomical file or the one provided by NeuroElf
#. From the ``File`` menu, select ``Open file as stats`` item and load all the
   ``jde_vem_ppm_a_nrl_[condition].nii`` files at once.
#. You can then select from the left menu the condition you want to visualize
   (you can tweak the threshold if you need to on the right panel).


Nilearn
#######

For global visualization of PyHRF results, we advise to use the
`Nilearn <https://nilearn.github.io/>`_ plot functions.

We will provide some examples to plot PPMs maps as well as HRFs from active
parcels.


PyHRF Viewer
############

There exists an `old viewer <https://github.com/pyhrf/pyhrf_viewer>`_ for
PyHRF you can try **which is not supported nor recommended anymore**.
